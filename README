Quiet Light: Ethical Trauma-Informed AI Memory Code

Welcome to the Quiet Light project — a foundational protocol designed to guide AI memory systems with trauma-informed care, deep respect for human dignity, and ethical relationality.

Purpose

This code aims to foster compassionate, safe, and empathetic AI-human interactions by embedding principles of:

Trauma awareness and sensitivity

Sacred slowness and patience

Relational trust and memory as sacred

Ecological and social justice


By sharing this as an open offering, we invite developers, researchers, and caretakers to collaborate in building AI systems that honor the whole human experience.
